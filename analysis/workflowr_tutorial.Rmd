## Setting up workflowR on Midway3/Midway2

The point of this short memo is to go over requirements, setting up, and working on a workflowR environment using a template from our Lab group. 

### First Step: Installing Environment

In order to run workflowR, you need to first setup a working environment for the template. In order to do this we will use conda/miniconda.

A) Create a env.yaml file:

  ```
  name: workflowr
  channels:
    - conda-forge
    - bioconda
    - defaults
  dependencies:
    - python>=3.7
    - mamba
    - r-workflowr
    - r-base
    - gh
    - r-data.table
    - r-tidyverse
  ```

B) Create the conda enviroment with the config above (assuming conda is setup):

  ```
  conda env create -f path/to/env.yaml
  ```

### Second Step: Configuring the Environment

  The goal of this step is now to configuring your environement to your Github account and setup Github pages.

  ```
  conda activate workflowr
  ```

A) Clone template and check Github pages:

  Prior to cloning the github template, create a new github repositoyry under your account. For example we will create: "MyworkflowR" repository. Make sure to enable Github pages for your repository [here](https://docs.github.com/en/pages/getting-started-with-github-pages/configuring-a-publishing-source-for-your-github-pages-site).
  Then, clone the repo, re-initialize it, and change the origin remote to point to your new repository. 

  ```
  mkdir -p path/to/folder
  cd path/to/folder
  git clone https://github.com/XuanyaoLiuLab/wflowr_template.git
  cd wflowr_template
  git init
  git remote set-url origin https://github.com/USERNAME/MyworkflowR.git
  ```
  This should transfer over the origin for the cloned template over to the new repository you just created: "MyworkflowR", in your github account USERNAME. 

B) Personal Access Tokens:

  It is now time to setup git with our personal access tokens.

  Go to your account settings [here](https://github.com/settings/tokens). Create a new token to use with this enviroment. Copy this token temporarily.

  The token should look like this:
  ```
  ghp_cgq4ZrHmFu0lLNl7ajKAwgNPnT5zhF00000
  ```

### Third Step: Pushing First Update

  This next step is aimed at publishing our cloned template to our new repository: "MyworkflowR". The workflowR template was made by Lili in our lab group.

  ```
  git push -u origin master
  ```

  Normally this will be the way you update your workflowr to Github. If you have not logged in before using the CLI/git, you will be prompted for a username and password:

  ```
  $ git push -u origin master
  Username: <your-username>
  Password: <your-token>
  ```

  Here enter your username and token from above. These will be cached for later. Here are some optional troubleshooting commands:

  ```
  git config --global credential.https://github.com.username USERNAME
  git config --global user.name "USERNAME"
  git config --global user.email "0000000+USERNAME@users.noreply.github.com"
  ```

### (Example Modification) Fourth Step: Modifying .RMD inside Template

This step is not necessary but aims to give an example where we modify a workflowR page (.RMD), then upload and publish our page to our new workflowR.

A) First make changes to the .RMD markdown file in wflowr_template/analysis*. For example, we add a figure and a table.

B) Run wflow_publish in order to build HTML pages + commit pages from all .RMDs in analysis folder.

  In R terminal:

  ```
  library("workflowr")
  setwd('path/to/folder/wflowr_template')
  wflow_publish("analysis/*.Rmd", "update", republish = TRUE)
  ```

C) Git add and commit any additional files, such as the figures, tables, etc.

  ```
  git add data/table.csv
  git add docs/figureA.png
  git commit --all
  ```

D) Push changes/checkout developmental branch

  ```
  git push -u origin master
  ```
